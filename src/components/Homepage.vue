      <h2>Shop Background</h2>
      <p>Since the pandemic started, online shopping become much popular for obvious 
reasons to avoid crowded places and we are all staying home due to the virus. We 
can directly buy anything from a seller without any aggravation. Shoppers can always 
visit online shops anytime and anywhere it is convenient for all of us.

   <h4>So we decided to use this idea to apply it on our web application, when you visit a 
online shopping app you will see a variety of items you can buy. Add to cart a item 
you are interested with but the order can always be edited if you changed your mind 
and order something else.</h4>
